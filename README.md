User's Manual for "Carbon Footprint Calculator"

The purpose of this website is to allow users to see the carbon footprint of their daily activities, learn the individual emissions for each activity, log them, and compare with other users.

First, the user can register an account with the restriction of having a minimum of 8 characters in their password. Then, the user can log in and be taken to the homepage, which is just visual images and an overarching paragraph.
The navigation bar at the top allows the user to go from one page of the website to another.

The first page is "Input New Activity," which allows the user to log an activity (types of transportation and food consumption) from that day.
Once they click submit, the database updates their total miles traveled, meat eaten, and total carbon emissions from those activities.
The user can continually input new activities, and the day they used it will be automatically updated.

The second page is "Your Footprint," which the user can use to view their history of activities based on each day.
Here, the user can see the total number of miles they have traveled, the total kilograms of meat they've consumed, and their total carbon emissions fom each day.

Next is "What's the Cost?" This page allows the user to type into a form a specific activity type, which will then take them to a page that tells them exactly how many kilograms of CO2 result from a specific unit of that activity.
Since Input New Activity doesn't show the user exactly how carbon intensive an activity is, it simply adds it to their footprint, this page allows users to know which are the most and least carbon intensive.

"Ways to Improve" shows three activities, car travel, air travel, and beef consumption, alongside some facts about how common they are and thus how much their emissions are.
This page prompts the users to view eco-friendly alternatives when they click a button for each activity.

The last page is the scoreboard, which encourages users to decrease their carbon footprint by ranking the users in the database and their total carbon emissions.
