Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've written out a plan for using the Finance pset as a template for how I want my website to be, as well as the additional changes (i.e. pages of the website) that I need to add.
I've also made pseudocode for the calculations that will convert categories like miles traveled to carbon emissions, that will be modeled from the quote and buy pages of Finance.
I have also researched the corresponding factors for conversions from data inputs from the user to carbon emissions.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet implemented any real code. I only have comments in what I need to write. I haven't made any additional html pages.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

These problems followed from the Finance Pset, but I am having trouble learning how to have the data that the user inputs reflect onto history/diary once it has been input into a database.
