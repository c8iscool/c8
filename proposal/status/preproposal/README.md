# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Carbon Footprint Counter

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that counts your carbon footprint based on input of driving/eating/other.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Calculate the carbon emissions based on mile of type of transportation, based on type of meat or veg. food input, how many electronics were charged, etc.
There are formulas I will implement that will see the amount of carbon emissions per mile traveled and through what type of transportation (public, car, air, etc.)
and type of food that you eat, and how many electronics you used/charged.
Keep a daily goal to set, provide suggestions if over.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A better understanding (since i don't have any right now) of how to properly convey code to a pretty User interface. I know that websites can be made very simply but will look unprofessional and not aesthetic.
I hope to have a user-friendly and simple website that will encourage the users to be mindful of their carbon footprint.

The code to calculate the carbon emissions from each category that I collect seems like the most straightforward path, so hopefully I will be able to accomplish that no matter what, even if the website doesn't look that great.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want the final project to have a main page, a page for facts and suggestions with images. There should be forms (user input) for a designated set of categories, such as transportation, electricty, and food.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition to all of the features listed above, I would like to implement a diary/journal or calendar that keeps a running sum of how much the user has emmitted since starting.
By clicking each day/cell in the calendar, it should take the user to a page that has a record of what was used on that day, as well as a running sum for each category.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn how to create an interactive table that allows the user to access a variety of pages.
This means that I have to become significantly more comfortable with Javascript and I also want it to look nice and be user-friendly, so I also need to become familiar with Bootstrap.
I will research different themes of existing html templates/formats to see how the features I want are implemented. I also have to research the basic facts/formulas for the carbon emitted per category that I'm prompting the user for.
I would probably base the number of criteria on how long or complex each calculation is, which will have a form and then update tables in the actual HTML code based on the user's inputs.
