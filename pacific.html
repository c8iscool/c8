            Pacific means "peaceful", coming from the Latin "pace" for peace and the Pacific Ocean got its name from the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 who called its waters "mar pacifico" which means peaceful sea.
            The Pacific is the biggest ocean on earth and covers more than 30% of the earth’s surface. With a surface of 169,479,000sqkm/65,436,200sqmiles. It provides almost half of the Earth’s water area. Did you know that the size of the Pacific Ocean is bigger than the total size of the landmass of all the continents together?
