            THE SOUTHERN OCEAN

        <div class="container-fluid">
            The Southern Ocean is located in the southern hemisphere, south of 60 degrees South latitude. It surrounds Antarctica. The Southern Ocean is thus 'emerging' from the waters of the South Atlantic Ocean, the South Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean in latitudes south of 60 degrees South.

            The Southern Ocean is also referred to as the Antarctic Ocean, South Polar Ocean or Austral Ocean. The Southern Ocean is the youngest ocean as it was formed 'only' 30 million years ago when South America and Antarctica moved apart. How big is the Southern Ocean? The Southern Ocean is the fourth biggest (or second smallest) ocean on earth and covers only 6% of the earthâ€™s surface.

            Icebergs will be encountered in the Southern Ocean during any season, but during May to October there are also strong winds which make crossing the ocean even more dangerous. Big iceberg fragments (huge junks of ice) drift in the water. They can big several hundred metres high! Ice fragments are considered small if they are not thicker than 1m/3ft. Still even in summer ice-breaker ships often need to escort ships on their passage through the Antarctic waters.
